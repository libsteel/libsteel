libsteel
========

libsteel is a strong data structures library that gives you control without costing you much.

C++ has the STL which is pretty ok. But C doesn't have templates like C++ does and the STL
isn't always as perfomant as it could be because of templating. Introducing steel, an abstract
data structures library that allows you to store any kind of data you'd like while still
controlling the layout of the data. Steel is strong and provides great scafolding on which you
can build a rock solid application while not requiring that you to rewrite a specialized
data structure for each new data type your application uses.

libsteel is young and we're still getting a feel for how we wanna do things. Bear with us while we solidify things.

Implemented Data Structures
===========================

The following data structures are in the process of being implemented/have been implemented.
* Singly linked list with a head and a tail.
* AVL tree.

Planned Data Structures
=======================
* Doubly Linked List
* Circularly Linked List
* Skip List
* Red Black Tree
* Kd-tree
* Treap
* Hash Map
* Dequeue
* Basic Queue
* Basic Stack
* Priority Queue
* Vector

"We're thinking about it" Data Structures
=========================================
* Heaps
* Graphs

Who are we?

Questions/Comments?
==================
Is there a data structure you would like that isn't on here? Did we screw up? Would you just
like to tells us that we're the bee's knees? Talk to us! We're in the #steel
